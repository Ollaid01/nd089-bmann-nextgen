Quiz: Compound Data Structures

Collections

When we have a group of data we can think about it as a collection (of data elements). In this lesson, we have seen many different data structures that Python provides for storing, accessing and manipulating collections of data. In particular, we have seen lists, sets, and dictionaries.

In the next few quizzes, you will have a chance to practice and review the properties of lists, sets, and dictionaries.

Quiz Question

Check all the attributes of a collection for which using a Python list would be appropriate.
